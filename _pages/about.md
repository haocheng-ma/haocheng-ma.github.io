Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

Since March 2023, I am a Security Researcher at Huawei. 

I completed my Ph.D in Hardware Security from Tianjin University, under the supervision of Prof. Yiqiang Zhao and Prof. Yier Jin. Before that, I received my B.S. in Microelectronics from Tianjin University.

My areas of research are Hardware Security and Confidential Computing. In particular, my expertise and interests include:

- Computer-aided Design (CAD) for Hardware Security Verification
- Hardware-enabled side-channel attacks and defenses
- Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Hardware Root of Trust (RoT), Measured boot and Attestation

Feel free to drop me an email if you are looking for research collaboration or interns on Confidential Computing.
