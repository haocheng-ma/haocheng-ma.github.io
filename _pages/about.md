Hi there ✨ Thanks for visiting my page!

I’ve been a Security Researcher at Huawei since March 2023.

I earned my Ph.D in Hardware Security from Tianjin University, under the supervision of Prof. Yiqiang Zhao and Prof. Yier Jin. Prior to that, I received my B.S. in Microelectronics, also from Tianjin University.

My research focuses on Hardware Security and Confidential Computing, with particular interests and expertise in:

- Computer-aided Design (CAD) for Hardware Security Verification
- Hardware-enabled Side-channel Attacks and Defenses
- Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Hardware Root of Trust (RoT), Measured boot and Attestation
